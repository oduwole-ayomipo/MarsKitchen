### Overview 👨‍🏫
Mars Kitchen is a resturant website designed by Oduwole Ayooo using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Responsiveness across multiple screens and viewport width was the forefront of this project. The website has a very elegant landing page with animation to improve user experience during interaction. It also has a very responsive navigation bar (that collapses on mobile view) in order to help the users easily navigate the website. Furthermore, the website has a detailed about section - that informs the users what mars kitchen is all about, a menu section - that caonsists of the different delicacy prepared by mars kitchen, a reservation section - wheere users and customers can book a table and reserve a seat prior to their next visit, a testimony section - where three distinct testimonies are documented and finally, a contact us page - where users can contact the officials and staffs at Mars Kitchen.
